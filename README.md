# NPCme
Block&change Hackathon

This project is about making a difference in the content world.
From NPCme we enourage people to go out there and explore the infinit posibilities this platform can get you. 

As it names shows, NPCme is a place where people look for a different interactive experience where they are in control of whats happening and not in a virtual world but in actual reality. Ideas come a lot but the illusion to pursuit new solutions all over the world is a different thing. 
This project started from the concept of giving the people the right to earn fairly about what they can do. This is not just a dApp, with this tool you can develope several business for companys as educational or more technicism. Who is sometime in need for knowledge and all they can do is send an email and wait. In here you can find anyone in this world that matches with your interest. 

NPCme is the new streaming P2P platform that looks for the most personalised and complete experience a screen could give.
Come join us and let's be everyone!
